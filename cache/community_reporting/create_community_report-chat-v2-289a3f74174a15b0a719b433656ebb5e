It should not be relied upon for unnecessary steering adjustments, as the driver remains responsible for always paying attention to road conditions and actively controlling the vehicle.\n\nThe system may sometimes lead to misuse or neglect, potentially causing accidents if over-reliance occurs. Therefore, it is advised that drivers do not solely depend on this technology or attempt dangerous driving with its assistance. The performance of the Lane Departure Warning System might also be affected by issues with the smart forward camera sensor.\n\nIn certain circumstances, the system may autonomously correct steering or apply corrective measures, although this depends on the specific conditions and reliability of the vehicle's systems. The LDWS continuously monitors lane markings and alerts drivers when they are drifting out of their lane, enabling them to take appropriate action if needed. This helps in maintaining control over the vehicle and potentially reduces the risk of accidents.\n\nIn summary, while the Lane Departure Warning System serves as a valuable aid for safe driving by detecting unintended lane departures and providing warnings or steering assistance, it should not replace the driver's responsibility to maintain awareness of road conditions and actively manage their vehicle. The system may require regular maintenance and sensor checks to ensure optimal performance and reliability.\",3\n1249,\"\"\"\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u5f53\u6216\u758f\u5ffd\u5927\u610f\"\"\",,1\n1247,\"\"\"\u7ea0\u6b63\u529b\u77e9\"\"\",\"\"\"Corrective torque refers to the force applied by the system to correct an unintended deviation from the lane, allowing the driver to take over control when they feel this is inappropriate.\"\"\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,rank\n60,\"\"\"\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\"\"\",\"\"\"\u8f66\u9053\u504f\u79bb\u7cfb\u7edf\"\"\",\"The entity \"\"\\u9a7e\\u9a76\\u5458\"\" interacts with the \"\"\\u8f66\\u9053\\u504f\\u79bb\\u7cfb\\u7edf\"\", utilizing it for steering corrections or taking over control as needed.
