It also functions as an adaptive cruise control system that automatically adjusts the following distance to the leading vehicle during cruise control. ACC provides automatic cruise control systems and may advise against using the system in conditions of heavy traffic, poor visibility (nighttime, backlighting, rain, fog, etc.), indicating its role in providing safety guidelines for vehicle systems. It controls the relative distance and speed between leading vehicles and the vehicle on the same path through real-time control, demonstrating its role in adaptive cruise control systems. ACC provides driving guidance and alerts drivers about potential issues with its system such as blocked sensors or performance degradation due to decorations. Additionally, it offers safety features for vehicles specifically focusing on maintaining appropriate speed and distance from the vehicle in front. ACC refers to an advanced cruise control system that allows drivers to reactivate through the accelerator pedal. It also provides limitations of ICA's vehicle speed assistance in a specific chapter or section. Lastly, ACC is an organization that does not respond or responds only to a limited extent to certain matters, indicating its role in traffic control or safety systems and may prompt recommendations for immediate inspection at authorized car dealerships when malfunctioning.\",10\n411,\"\"\"MILLING WAVE RADAR\"\"\",\"\"\"Milling Wave Radar is a technology component used by the ACC system to detect relative distance and speed between vehicles.\"\"\",1\n412,\"\"\"INTELLIGENT FRONT CAMERA ON WINDSHIELD\"\"\",\"\"\"Intelligent Front Camera on Windshield is another technology component of the ACC system that helps in detecting relative distances and speeds.\"\"\",1\n1617,\"\"\"SMART FORWARD CAMERA\"\"\",\"\"\"An advanced smart forward camera that improves efficiency, also utilized by ACC to detect relative distances and speeds between vehicles.\"\"\",1\n1699,\"\"\"ROAD CONDITIONS\"\"\",\"\"\"Road Conditions encompass a wide range of scenarios that might not be fully addressed by an Integrated Cruise Assistance (CCA) system, necessitating human intervention. These include various situations where using Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) could be unsafe or ineffective, such as urban driving environments, traffic congestion, sharp turns, poor road conditions like ice, fog, gravel-covered roads, heavy rain, and slippery surfaces, as well as off-road areas. Additionally, factors affecting the system's ability to assist in steering correction include overloading of vehicles, anomalies in tire pressure, uneven surfaces, strong side winds, and improper assembly of vehicle control components.
