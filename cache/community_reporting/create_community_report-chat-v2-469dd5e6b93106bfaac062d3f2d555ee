Firstly, it denotes an emphasis on promoting safe driving practices aimed at minimizing accident risks. This involves adhering to traffic rules, maintaining vehicle condition, and practicing defensive driving techniques. Secondly, \"\"Safety\"\" also signifies the comprehensive protection offered by SRS (Supplemental Restraint System), particularly through the deployment of airbags designed to safeguard passengers in case of collisions or sudden stops.
