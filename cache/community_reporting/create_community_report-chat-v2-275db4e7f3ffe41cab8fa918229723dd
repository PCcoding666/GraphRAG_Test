It acts as an autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicle control mechanism, stepping in to correct the steering when required. Additionally, it is equipped with advanced features such as automatically turning on or off indicators based on changes in ambient light conditions and alerting drivers under specific driving scenarios. This system is identified as an Advanced Driving Assistance System (ADAS), which intervenes to correct steering when necessary.\"\"\",3\n1092,\"\"\"ROAD CONDITIONS\"\"\",\"Road Conditions encompass a wide range of scenarios that impact vehicle safety and the performance of various systems like ACC (Adaptive Cruise Control), ICA (Intelligent Cruise Assistance), ADB (Adaptive Driving Beam), among others. These conditions include wetlands or cement surfaces requiring caution when using ACC features, uneven surfaces, ice, water, urban areas with traffic congestion, winding roads, poor road conditions such as ice, fog, gravel-covered roads, heavy rain, slippery surfaces, and no-road zones. They also involve factors affecting the Advanced Driving Assistance System (ADAS), like overloading, tire pressure issues, uneven surfaces, strong side winds which can influence how well ADAS performs when correcting steering.\n\nThe importance of focusing on road conditions cannot be overstated as they are critical in preventing accidents by impacting vehicle safety systems and ensuring smooth operation. Road conditions include scenarios that drivers might encounter while operating their vehicles such as speed control, avoiding damage from obstacles, driving on uneven surfaces, handling slopes, slippery roads, wet slippery roads, and smooth roads.\n\nMoreover, road conditions play a significant role in how the ADB system operates by adapting its light pattern based on these varying environmental factors. This highlights the dynamic nature of road conditions affecting not just vehicle safety but also the functionality of advanced driving technologies designed to enhance driver assistance and overall road safety.\",3\n2581,\"\"\"CAUSES OF ACCIDENTS\"\"\",,2\n2578,\"\"\"DIVERSION OF ATTENTION\"\"\",\"\"\"Diversion of Attention can lead to accidents, highlighting the need for drivers to maintain focus while operating a vehicle.\"\"\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,rank\n231,\"\"\"DRIVER\"\"\",\"\"\"SYSTEM\"\"\",\"\"\"The system assists the driver by correcting steering when necessary.\"\"\",21\n108,\"\"\"ORGANIZATION\"\"\",\"\"\"SYSTEM\"\"\",\"\"\"The organization likely refers to the manufacturer or developer of the vehicle safety system.\"\"\",18\n252,\"\"\"ACC\"\"\",\"\"\"ROAD CONDITIONS\"\"\",\"\"\"ACC's effectiveness may be compromised under certain road conditions like urban areas, traffic congestion, winding roads, poor road conditions, no-road zones, ice, fog, gravel-covered roads, heavy rain, slippery surfaces.\"\"\",14\n257,\"\"\"ROAD CONDITIONS\"\"\",\"\"\"SYSTEM\"\"\",\"\"\"Various road conditions can impact how effectively an advanced driving assistance system (ADAS) performs in correcting steering.\"\"\",6\n258,\"\"\"ROAD CONDITIONS\"\"\",\"\"\"CAUSES OF ACCIDENTS\"\"\",\"\"\"Road conditions significantly contribute to accidents, underscoring the importance of being attentive while driving.\"\"\",5\n397,\"\"\"DIVERSION OF ATTENTION\"\"\",\"\"\"CAUSES OF ACCIDENTS\"\"\",\"\"\"Distracted attention can result in accidents, emphasizing the need for drivers to maintain focus while operating a vehicle.\"\"\",3\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
