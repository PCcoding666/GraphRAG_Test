This system utilizes sensors and forward-facing cameras to assist in vehicle safety systems, which can be affected by dirt or obstructions on the sensor surface. ACC operates under certain conditions and limitations, requiring user attention and judgment for ensuring safe driving. It is developed and implemented by organizations specializing in adaptive cruise control systems, which automatically adjust vehicle following distance during cruising. The system provides automatic cruise control capabilities that can make vehicles drive out after confirmation through control buttons or accelerator pedals. Additionally, ACC refers to an organization providing adaptive cruise control services, indicated by the color change in the system to show its operational status. It also offers driving assistance and safety features for vehicles while being part of a broader set of services provided by organizations like ICA.
