This system is also the vehicle's integrated system that monitors and controls various functions, maintaining vehicle status after startup through its memory function for switch states. It plays a role in applying braking when the vehicle tends towards oversteering or understeering, adjusting the force based on which wheel it applies to. The system can be seen as an organization responsible for providing reminders and alerts based on certain conditions, depending on whether there is a need for manual control or automation.\n\nIn some scenarios, \"\"\\u7cfb\\u7edf\"\" might not trigger during specific driving situations like drifting, uneven terrain, or the vehicle's path and speed. It can also be understood as a system that monitors and assists drivers in controlling their vehicles, considering factors such as fuel efficiency and engine performance. The system is designed to inform users about potential risks and issues related to driving conditions.\n\nIn other contexts, \"\"\\u7cfb\\u7edf\"\" refers to the ability of the vehicle's system to self-monitor and self-report its status or condition, providing real-time feedback on the vehicle's operational state or any anomalies. It can be seen as a feature that enables drivers to receive alerts about their driving conditions, serving as an essential tool for maintaining safety and efficiency during operation.\n\nIn summary, \"\"\\u7cfb\\u7edf\"\" encompasses various aspects of vehicle automation and control systems, including alerting drivers when they are not in control, monitoring and adjusting functions based on the vehicle's state or external conditions, providing reminders and alerts to enhance driving safety and efficiency.\",4\n1326,\"\"\"\u5de5\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\"\"\",\"\"\"Work Conditions refers to the detailed circumstances and scenarios designed to ensure the system functions efficiently and safely for drivers.

In this context, when encountering such conditions (where the vehicle is moving in an off-center direction), the Electronic Stability Program (ESP) intervenes by applying brakes predominantly on the rear wheels located on the inner side of the bend. This action aims to correct the vehicle's path and maintain stability during turns.\n\nThe description also alludes to a situation where, despite the ESP's involvement, there is no explicit explanation provided regarding its performance or effectiveness in managing this specific scenario. The text seems to imply that while the ESP does play a role through braking mechanisms, it might not be clearly communicating its actions or outcomes to the driver, possibly due to lack of feedback or insufficient information being conveyed about its operational details during understeer conditions.\n\nIn summary, when dealing with understeering situations, the vehicle's stability control system (ESP) employs rear wheel braking on the inner side as part of its corrective measures. However, there is a need for clearer communication from the ESP to ensure that drivers are adequately informed about its actions and effectiveness in maintaining vehicular stability during off-center driving scenarios.\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,rank\n57,\"\"\"\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\"\"\",\"\"\"\u7cfb\u7edf\"\"\",\"The entity \"\"\\u9a7e\\u9a76\\u5458\"\" (Driver) interacts with the system to ensure safety when operating a vehicle.
