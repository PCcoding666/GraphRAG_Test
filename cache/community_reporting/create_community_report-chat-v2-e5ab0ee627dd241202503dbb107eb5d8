Challenges related to visibility and road conditions may face the driver of a vehicle equipped with snow chains, who needs to follow specific guidelines for safe operation when leaving or parking the vehicle. The driver's responsibility and interaction with technology are highlighted in their involvement with an ADAS system, especially during city traffic congestion or poor visibility.\n\nThe roles could potentially refer to individuals within the organization performing observations or evaluations, possibly including unnamed personnel or unspecified roles such as '\\u98ce', who might be part of the team working on vehicle control components.
