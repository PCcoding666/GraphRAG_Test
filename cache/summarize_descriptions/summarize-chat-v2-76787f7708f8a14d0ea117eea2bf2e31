{"result": "\"Automatic parking in function of '\\u81ea\\u52a8\\u6cca\\u5165\\u529f\\u80fd'\" refers to a system that automatically recognizes both horizontal and vertical parking spaces. There is a certain probability of misidentification due to limitations, which implies the system might not always accurately identify suitable parking spots. However, it also describes '\\u81ea\\u52a8\\u6cca\\u5165\\u529f\\u80fd' as being part of an efficient parking process where once a space is located, the vehicle automatically maneuvers into its position. This suggests that despite potential misidentification issues during initial recognition, the system successfully guides the car into the identified spot autonomously.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
