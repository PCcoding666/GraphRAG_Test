{"result": "The entity \"\\u5236\\u52a8\\u52a9\\u529b\\u5668\" refers to an organization or system designed to enhance the force exerted on the brake pedal by a driver, particularly when the engine is operational. This entity serves as a component of the vehicle's braking system that facilitates increased pressure during braking operations. It acts as a supplementary mechanism that amplifies the driver's input for more effective and efficient deceleration or stopping of the vehicle under various conditions.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
