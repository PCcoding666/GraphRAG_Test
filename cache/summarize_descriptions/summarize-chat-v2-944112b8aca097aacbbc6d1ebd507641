{"result": "Here is a comprehensive summary of the data provided:\n\n**Electric Power Steering (EPS)**\n\nElectric Power Steering (EPS) is a type of power steering system that uses an electric motor to provide assistive torque. It consists of integrated components, including a torque transfer angle sensor (TAS), motor, reduction mechanism, and electronic control unit (ECU). As a system related to vehicle safety features, EPS plays a crucial role in ensuring the organization and implementation of various safety features within vehicles. Furthermore, it is a technology specifically related to electric power steering systems, leveraging the benefits of electric motors to enhance steering performance and efficiency.\n\nNote: I resolved the contradictions by focusing on the core description provided for EPS, which emphasizes its technical aspects as a power steering system. The additional descriptions were used to provide context and clarify the role of EPS in vehicle safety features and technology.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
