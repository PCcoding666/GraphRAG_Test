He is remembered by his family and Scrooge as being patient and mild. Despite their poverty, Tiny Tim's family celebrates Christmas with joy and gratitude, and he participates in the festivities, enjoying the goose dinner and singing well. His spirit is from God, and he is happy, but also has a deep understanding of the struggles of those around him. The gift being twice his size is used as a joke, referencing a previous event or character in the story.
