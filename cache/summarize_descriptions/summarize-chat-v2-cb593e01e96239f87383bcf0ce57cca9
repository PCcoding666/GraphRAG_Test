However, he eventually decides to raise Bob's salary and assist his family, demonstrating a significant change in his disposition towards Bob. Despite this positive shift, Scrooge remains frustrated with Bob's habitual lateness and confronts him about it. Additionally, Scrooge makes a light-hearted joke about sending something to Bob's place, indicating a more relaxed and friendly interaction between the two.
