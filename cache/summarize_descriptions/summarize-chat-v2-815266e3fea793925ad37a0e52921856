{"result": "\"Electronic parking brake is a feature on vehicles that enables braking when the engine is off. This system serves as an additional safety function, particularly useful during driving to prevent unwanted movement of the vehicle. It can be operated manually or remotely, including self-diagnosis, monitoring and troubleshooting functions. The electronic parking brake operates through a control mechanism using electrical signals, providing a unique way to apply braking force compared to traditional mechanical systems.\"", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
