{"result": "\"The System refers to the vehicle safety systems specifically focusing on Intelligent Cruise Assistance (ICA), playing a crucial role in modern vehicles. It acts as an autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicle control mechanism, stepping in to correct the steering when required. Additionally, it is equipped with advanced features such as automatically turning on or off indicators based on changes in ambient light conditions and alerting drivers under specific driving scenarios. This system is identified as an Advanced Driving Assistance System (ADAS), which intervenes to correct steering when necessary.\"", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
