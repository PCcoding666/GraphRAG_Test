{"result": "Here is the comprehensive summary of the data provided:\n\n**THE GHOST**\n\nThe Ghost is a supernatural entity that plays a significant role in the life of Scrooge. It appears to him as a companion, accompanying him through his house. As they spend more time together, The Ghost grows older, indicating its ability to age and change over time. Additionally, it showcases its powers, demonstrating its supernatural nature. Furthermore, The Ghost is described as giving light and wearing a cap, highlighting its unique characteristics.\n\nNote: I have resolved the contradictions by assuming that the growing older aspect refers to The Ghost's appearance in relation to Scrooge, rather than an actual physical change in The Ghost itself.
