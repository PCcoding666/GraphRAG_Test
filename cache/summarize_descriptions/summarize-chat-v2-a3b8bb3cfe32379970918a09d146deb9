{"result": "\"The System\" refers to an advanced automated safety feature primarily focused on enhancing vehicular safety by closely monitoring driver behavior. This sophisticated technology is designed not only to assist in steering correction but also acts as a proactive intervention mechanism when necessary, ensuring that drivers maintain safe and attentive operation of their vehicles. Specifically, it includes the capability to monitor drivers for prolonged periods without hands on the steering wheel, thereby providing an additional layer of safety by promptly alerting or taking corrective actions if required. This system is engineered to contribute significantly to overall road safety by mitigating risks associated with distracted driving and promoting responsible behavior behind the wheel.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
