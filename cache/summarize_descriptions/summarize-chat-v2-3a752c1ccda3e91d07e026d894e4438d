It is an event that people participate in by wishing each other a merry Christmas, and it is also a time for celebration and joy. However, as experienced by Ebenezer Scrooge, Christmas can be a holiday that challenges one's views on charity and kindness. Initially, Scrooge decides to honor Christmas in his heart throughout the year, but after being visited by the Ghost of Christmas Present, he experiences it in a new way and comes to appreciate its true meaning.
