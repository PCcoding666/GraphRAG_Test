When he roused himself from his thoughtful quest, he fancied,\nfrom the turn of the hand, and its situation in reference to himself,\nthat the Unseen Eyes were looking at him keenly. It made him shudder,\nand feel very cold.\n\nThey left the busy scene, and went into an obscure part of the town,\nwhere Scrooge had never penetrated before, although he recognised its\nsituation and its bad repute. The ways were foul and narrow; the shop\nand houses wretched; the people half naked, drunken, slipshod, ugly.\nAlleys and archways, like so many cesspools, disgorged their offences of\nsmell and dirt, and life upon the straggling streets; and the whole\nquarter reeked with crime, with filth, and misery.\n\nFar in this den of infamous resort, there was a low-browed, beetling\nshop, below a penthouse roof, where iron, old rags, bottles, bones, and\ngreasy offal were bought. Upon the floor within were piled up heaps of\nrusty keys, nails, chains, hinges, files, scales, weights, and refuse\niron of all kinds. Secrets that few would like to scrutinise were bred\nand hidden in mountains of unseemly rags, masses of corrupted fat, and\nsepulchres of bones. Sitting in among the wares he dealt in, by a\ncharcoal stove made of old bricks, was a grey-haired rascal, nearly\nseventy years of age, who had screened himself from the cold air without\nby a frouzy curtaining of miscellaneous tatters hung upon a line and\nsmoked his pipe in all the luxury of calm retirement.\n\nScrooge and the Phantom came into the presence of this man, just as a\nwoman with a heavy bundle slunk into the shop. But she had scarcely\nentered, when another woman, similarly laden, came in too; and she was\nclosely followed by a man in faded black, who was no less startled by\nthe sight of them than they had been upon the recognition of each other.\nAfter a short period of blank astonishment, in which the old man with\nthe pipe had joined them, they all three burst into a laugh.\n\n'Let the charwoman alone to be the first!' cried she who had entered\nfirst. 'Let the laundress alone to be the second; and let the\nundertaker's man alone to be the third. Look here, old Joe, here's a\nchance! If we haven't all three met here without meaning it!'\n\n'You couldn't have met in a better place,' said old Joe, removing his\npipe from his mouth. 'Come into the parlour. You were made free of it\nlong ago, you know; and the other two an't strangers. Stop till I shut\nthe door of the shop. Ah! how it skreeks! There an't such a rusty bit of\nmetal in the place as its own hinges, I believe; and I'm sure there's no\nsuch old bones here as mine. Ha! ha! We're all suitable to our calling,\nwe're well matched. Come into the parlour. Come into the parlour.'\n\nThe parlour was the space behind the screen of rags. The old man raked\nthe fire together with an old stair-rod, and having trimmed his smoky\nlamp (for it was night) with the stem of his pipe, put it into his mouth\nagain.\n\nWhile he did this, the woman who had already spoken threw her bundle on\nthe floor, and sat down in a flaunting manner on a stool, crossing her\nelbows on her knees, and looking with a bold defiance at the other two.\n\n'What odds, then? What odds, Mrs. Dilber?' said the woman. 'Every person\nhas a right to take care of themselves. _He_ always did!'\n\n'That's true, indeed!' said the laundress. 'No man more so.'\n\n'Why, then, don't stand staring as if you was afraid, woman! Who's the\nwiser? We're not going to pick holes in each other's coats, I suppose?'\n\n'No, indeed!' said Mrs. Dilber and the man together. 'We should hope\nnot.'\n\n'Very well then!' cried the woman. 'That's enough. Who's the worse for\nthe loss of a few things like these? Not a dead man, I suppose?'\n\n'No, indeed,' said Mrs. Dilber, laughing.\n\n'If he wanted to keep 'em after he was dead, a wicked old screw,'\npursued the woman, 'why wasn't he natural in his lifetime? If he had\nbeen, he'd have had somebody to look after him when he was struck with\nDeath, instead of lying gasping out his last there, alone by himself.'\n\n'It's the truest word that ever was spoke,' said Mrs. Dilber. 'It's a\njudgment on him.'\n\n'I wish it was a little heavier judgment,' replied the woman: 'and it\nshould have been, you may depend upon it, if I could have laid my hands\non anything else. Open that bundle, old Joe, and let me know the value\nof it. Speak out plain. I'm not afraid to be the first, nor afraid for\nthem to see it. We knew pretty well that we were helping ourselves\nbefore we met here, I believe. It's no sin.
