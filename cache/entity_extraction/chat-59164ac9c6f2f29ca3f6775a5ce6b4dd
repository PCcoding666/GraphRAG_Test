The storming of the Bastille on July 14, 1789, marked a turning point in the revolution, as it symbolized the people's rejection of the monarchy and their demand for liberty, equality, and fraternity.\n\nThe National Assembly, which had been formed in 1789, played a crucial role in the revolution. This representative body was composed of deputies from all three estates (the clergy, the nobility, and the commoners) and was responsible for drafting the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen.\n\nAs the revolution gained momentum, the National Assembly became increasingly radicalized, leading to the establishment of the Committee of Public Safety in 1793. This committee, dominated by Maximilien Robespierre, would go on to play a key role in the Reign of Terror, during which thousands of perceived enemies of the revolution were executed.\n\nDespite its flaws and excesses, the French Revolution had a profound impact on modern history, shaping the course of politics, society, and culture for centuries to come.\n######################\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>\"Paris\"<|>\"location\"<|>\"Paris is described as a hub of activity during the French Revolution.\")##\n(\"entity\"<|>\"Bastille\"<|>\"event\"<|>\"The storming of the Bastille on July 14, 1789, marked a turning point in the French Revolution.\")##\n(\"entity\"<|>\"National Assembly\"<|>\"organization\"<|>\"The National Assembly played a crucial role in the French Revolution, drafting the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen.\")##\n(\"relationship\"<|>\"Paris\"<|>\"French Revolution\"<|>\"Paris was a hub of activity during the French Revolution.\"<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>\"Bastille\"<|>\"French Revolution\"<|>\"The storming of the Bastille marked a turning point in the French Revolution.\"<|>10)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>\"National Assembly\"<|>\"French Revolution\"<|>\"The National Assembly played a crucial role in the French Revolution.\"<|>8)<|COMPLETE|>\n#############################", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1.
